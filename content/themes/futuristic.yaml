    subtitle: The origin story of your guides through the technological singularity
  
  story:
    title: Our Timeline
    paragraphs:
      - "Vibecast.me emerged from a convergence of minds focused on the approaching technological event horizon. Established in early 2025, we recognized the need for forward-thinking discourse about the post-human era."
      - "Our mission transcends traditional technology discussion. We exist to prepare consciousness (human and otherwise) for the fundamental transformations that lie ahead as we approach the singularity."
      - "Each transmission features conversations with the architects of tomorrow's reality - quantum physicists, AI researchers, neurotechnologists, and transhumanist philosophers who are actively building the bridge to our post-human future."
